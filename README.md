Guidelines
==========

* Encoding of all files is utf-8.
* Indentation is 4 spaces. When using the space key to indent,
  it shall be pressed 4 times. One, two, three, four. Pressing it
  one, two or three times is not allowed, if not followed by
  pressing it a fourth time. Five is right out.
  However, every good text editor, and also Emacs, supports
  smart indentation via the tab key.
* After the 4 spaces, you must write well-thought-out code.
* A line shall be no longer than 120 symbols.
